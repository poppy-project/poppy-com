In this repo travis is used to create documentation, update readme, and pass some tests.
To activate all this things you have to follow some steps :

To have a perfect integration and declaration of your module into a poppy 2.0 network you have to:
 - specify your module in the mod_list.h list.
 - specify your MCU on the Makefile.
 - specify your MAINCLOCK frequency on the Makefile.
 - specify your SCLFREQ to specify the I2C max speed on the Makefile.
 - create your specific hal folder if you need. To do that please read the [new hal creation documentation](doc/hal_creation.md).

You can use the [template.c](template.c) file to format your main file and use it as base.
